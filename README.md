If you are a major in humanity, if you are, humanities major, I want you to come towards the purple towards me, and gather one group, wait on here I am.
If you are engineering major, if you are engineering go towards the screen and being blue.
If you are science major, science, be right in the middle.
And if you are something else, I want you to clear out to very very edge, just be on the edge, you can still be in the short, let’s, let’s see these groups 
You are all different colors in different years right? Keep your year, I hope you remember your year cause I don’t.
